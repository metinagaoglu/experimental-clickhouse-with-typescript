# click-house-olap-typescript

This is an experimental TypeScript project for performing Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) operations with the ClickHouse database.

## Introduction

OLAP is a data processing technique that allows you to quickly answer complex analytical queries over large datasets. ClickHouse is a popular columnar database that is well-suited for OLAP workloads due to its performance and scalability.

This project demonstrates how to connect to a ClickHouse database, perform OLAP operations, and visualize the results using TypeScript.
